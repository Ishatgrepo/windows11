## FAQ

### Why do Microsoft Store, Windows Activation, and some program installations not work?

Microsoft blocks access to the Microsoft Store and some of its services, including Windows Activation and Smart Screen, from Data Center IPs.

### How do I use it?

1. Start the container and connect to `http://localhost:8006` using your web browser.
2. Wait for the installation to complete.
3. Once you see the desktop, your Windows installation is ready for use.

### How do I select the Windows version?

By default, Windows 11 will be installed. To select a different version, add the `VERSION` environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
environment:
  VERSION: "win10"
```
Available versions:

| Value | Version | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `win11` | Windows 11 Pro | 6.4 GB |
| `win11e` | Windows 11 Enterprise | 5.8 GB |
| `win10` | Windows 10 Pro | 5.7 GB |
|... |... |... |

### How do I select the Windows language?

By default, the English version of Windows will be downloaded. To select a different language, add the `LANGUAGE` environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
environment:
  LANGUAGE: "French"
```
Available languages:

ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ª Arabic, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬ Bulgarian, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ Chinese, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· Croatian, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ Czech, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Danish, ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± Dutch, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English, ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ª Estionian, ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finnish, ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· French, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª German, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· Greek, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± Hebrew, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º Hungarian, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italian, ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japanese, ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· Korean, ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡» Latvian, ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡¹ Lithuanian, ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norwegian, ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± Polish, ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ Portuguese, ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ Romanian, ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º Russian, ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸ Serbian, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° Slovak, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡® Slovenian, ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spanish, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish, ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡­ Thai, ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· Turkish, and ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ Ukrainian.

### How do I connect using RDP?

The web-viewer is mainly meant to be used during installation. For a better experience, connect using any Microsoft Remote Desktop client to the IP of the container, using the username `Docker` and leaving the password empty.

### How do I assign an individual IP address to the container?

Create a macvlan network and assign an IP address to the container:
```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.0.1 \
  --ip-range=192.168.0.100/28 \
  -o parent
